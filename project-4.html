                    A fast-paced and high stakes card game intended for play in tabletop simulator. Make smart
                    investments into buildings that you think will give you the most benefit and use any action
                    cards you get to give yourself an advantage over the other players. The game only continues
                    while there is still money left in the deck, so once the economy dries up, the player with the
                    most money wins. Investment Andes was a group project and my contribution, along with my other
                    teammates, was the balancing of the game, the ideas for buildings and action cards, and the rules
                    of the game.<br><br>

                    There are 5 building options that all players have access to purchase, and they each have passive 
                    effects that in some way increase the amount of cards in your hand. The two cheapest buildings have 
                    the effect of increasing your draw at the start of your turn of one of the card types while the more 
                    expensive buildings will let you draw cards in response to the other players' actions. With only the 
                    building system, players with more money will simply be able to buy the better buildings and only get 
                    richer from there. To make the game more fair and randomized, action cards are an additional deck that 
                    you get to draw from that offer all sorts of effects. With action cards, you can stop other players' 
                    buildings from functioning, steal cards from another player, draw more cards, and reduce the cost of 
                    the buildings on your turn. The balance is never perfect because most players don't know that they should 
                    be trying to get more action cards when they're lower on money instead of money cards, but still with 
                    action cards the game gets more chaotic and competitive between the players.

                <ul><b>Challenges:</b>
                    <li>Balancing the game in such a way that the rich don't always get richer but also that money received 
                        feels earned and worthwhile.
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintaining the feel of the game for both small and large player groups.</li>
                    <li>Keeping the game's fast pace even when players need to count their money for every purchase 
                        and strategize what building to purchase.
                    </li>

                <ul><b>What I did well:</b>
                    <li>Reduced the number of buildings available in the game to an easily comprehensible 5. 
                        Originally there were way more buildings with various inconsistent effects and it was way 
                        too much.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gave players calculators to use and lowered the value of money as a whole so 
                        calculations for purchasing buildings and counting each player's final score.
                    </li>
                    <li>Designed a comprehensive and easy to read pdf of the game's rules that allows for quick 
                        access to labeled topics that a player would be specifically searching for.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p id="dislikes">
                <ul><b>What I would change/improve:</b>
                    <li>In general the action cards need to be seen by newer players as a viable option instead 
                        of them thinking they only need money. Possibly add more card examples in the rules so they 
                        understand what action cards can do.
                    </li>
                    <li>Action cards are a bit too strong I think, once players realize what they can do it's normally 
                        the player who gets the most action cards who wins the whole game. Lowering the limit 
                        of action cards that can be played in a turn could reduce their turn-by-turn strength and 
                        reducing the number of action cards that are: "Draw X money cards," or changing their effect 
                        to be more conditional.
                    </li>
                </ul>
