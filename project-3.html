                    An interactive simulation showcasing a genetic algorithm of a racecar learning to drive on a track.
                    Users first create a looped racetrack using the built-in track creator, then once they hit play the
                    simulation will start. During the simulation, batches of racecar AI are placed into the simulation in
                    generations. Each racecar agent starts with a randomized set of instructions to complete the track, and 
                    as each generation ends a new generation is made by "evolving" the previous generation. This means selecting
                    a certain number cars that had the best run and using their set of instructions or "chromosome" as the basis of
                    the new generation. This process is set to continue until an agent is found who completed the track at a high 
                    level of quality. This project was my introduction to genetic algorithms and can certainly be improved, but 
                    remains a good display of the algorithm's process and adaptability.<br><br>

                    What makes all of this work is the fitness function which is able to calculate how well each racecar agent did
                    in their run of the track. This drives the process of evolution and also determines when the simulation is finished.
                    Creating, testing, and improving the fitness function was one of the major challenges of the whole project.
                    I tried using average speed, track completion time, percentage of run within track boundaries, percentage of track
                    visited, and a completion check all as weighted variables that would add up to calculate the overall fitness.
                    In the end, I chose to use the inside boundaries percentage, track visitation percentage, and a completion check
                    to make up the entire calculation.<br><br>
                    
                    There's no denial that speed and lap time, as well as many other possible
                    statistics, are just as important, but too many unwanted behaviors arose when prioritizing these variables.
                    Racers would be able to achieve very high speeds by not turning often and going way out of the boundaries of
                    the track and racers would be able to achieve very low lap times by looping the starting line and going past it
                    again as a finish line. Unfortunately, most of these problems derive from my desire for the algorithm to adapt
                    from a starting point of complete freedom. While the track is visible to the users, it means nothing to the AI
                    as its doing its run. If the racetrack was a physical object and restricted the racers inside of the road area
                    with bounding walls at the edges, then most unwanted behvior I was getting would have been stopped from the start.<br><br>

                    In the end, most of this project's flaws come from it trying to adapt and accomodate to any possible racetrack that can
                    be created in the simulation. I was overly ambitious and overestimated the power of genetic algorithms thinking that they
                    would work the same on all possible tracks it would be presented with. But at the same time, with some additional tweaking
                    I feel the simulation can be greatly improved and be able to actually generate a quality racer that can complete most tracks
                    you give it.
