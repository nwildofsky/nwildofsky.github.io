            <h1>Nathan Wildofsky</h1>
            <h2>Game Developer and Designer</h2>
            <p>
                I am a game developer that enjoys the challenge of solving complex problems while also adding my own personal
                spin and creativity. I have years of experience in the C# and C++ languages, I am well versed in using Unity, and
                I am familiar with Unreal Engine 5. That being said, I am quick to learn new tools and programs and eager to sink
                my teeth into new languages.

                I like to focus on the programming and technical aspects of projects but I have the experience to put on the game design, 
                level design, and web design hats when needed.
                
                I enjoy working with a team full of talented people and creating products that are fun, interesting, and useful.

                    A 2D platformer developed in Unity and focused on level design. Made alongside a team of 4
                    where every member was tasked to create their own level that flows nicely into all the other
                    levels created by the team. I created the fourth level around the concept of entering the
                    dark forest and using lights placed in the level to make your way through the darkness.
                    In addition to creating a level, I also programmed the mechanics of the game. These include:
                    moving, jumping, wall sliding, wall jumping, and dashing. Players can also dash
                    into certain tiles to break them and activate lights and switches to progress through each level.

                    A quest mod of the game Starsector created for a class project and published publicly to NexusMods.
                    Explore an unknown solar system and find out what the mega corporation Tri-tachyon has been keeping
                    hidden for many years. Pick a side in the ongoing battle once there, put an end to the whole operation,
                    and leave with a new and dangerous weapon to add to your arsenal. Starsector is a fairly unknown open world
                    space RPG that is technically still pre-release, but has been worked on for over 10 years. Starsector has an
                    active modding community and plenty of helpful resources within its wiki, discord, and forums. Even still,
                    learning the codebase, working within it, and fixing all resulting errors by the end were quite the challenge.
                    This was a group project with a group of 4. My role was map implementation and asset design, but I also helped
                    a lot with mission sequencing and fixing errors in the code.

                <p>
                    An interactive simulation showcasing a genetic algorithm of a racecar learning to drive on a track.
                    Users first create a looped racetrack using the built-in track creator, then once they hit play the
                    simulation will start. During the simulation, batches of racecar AI are placed into the simulation in
                    generations. Each racecar agent starts with a randomized set of instructions to complete the track, and 
                    as each generation ends a new generation is made by "evolving" the previous generation. This means selecting
                    a certain number cars that had the best run and using their set of instructions or "chromosome" as the basis of
                    the new generation. This process is set to continue until an agent is found who completed the track at a high 
                    level of quality. This project was my introduction to genetic algorithms and can certainly be improved, but 
                    remains a good display of the algorithm's process and adaptability.

                <p>
                    A custom rendering engine built with C++ and utilizing DirectX 11. This was a semester-long class
                    project where every new feature was added one assignment at a time. Features individually worked on
                    and implemented are: virtual camera, camera controls, skyboxes, Dear ImGui UI for runtime modification,
                    custom pixel and vertex shaders written in hlsl, game entities with associated transforms, meshes, and
                    PBR materials, multiple light types, and shadow maps. The project also makes use of the professor's own
                    SimpleShader library which makes the process of implementing and integrating shaders into a DirectX application
                    a lot more convenient. I really enjoyed working on this project and put all my effort into making the engine
                    as functional as possible but also structuring the code in a organized and understandable way. As such,
                    this project serves as the best example of my skill with C++.

                <p>
                    A connect-the-dots style puzzle game crafted in Unity and inspired by the Ethshar universe.
                    Talisman of Ethshar consists of 15 levels of increasingly difficult puzzles where you are tasked
                    with recreating the "talisman" image in the bottom right by connecting the dots one-by-one.
                    You can start your line at any dot and can connect to any dot from there but you cannot go back
                    across a line you've already drawn. As you progress through the game, new mechanics are introduced
                    that keep the puzzles fresh, fun, and challenging. This was a group project and my responsibilities
                    were designing most of the puzzles, creating the look and feel of the game, and programming the

                <p>
                    A 3D Murder Mystery game built in Unity and set in the Dresden Files universe. Players are able
                    to search multiple open scenes for any clues that will help them decifer the strange unexplained
                    murder before them. Then, speak with the suspects to see every side of the story and piece together
                    what really happened. This was a group project and my contribution was mainly the level design, the
                    sequencing of the series of events, and some of the functionality of interacting with clues and
                    tracking the players' interactions.

                <p>
                    A fast-paced and high stakes card game intended for play in tabletop simulator. Make smart
                    investments into buildings that you think will give you the most benefit and use any action
                    cards you get to give yourself an advantage over the other players. The game only continues
                    while there is still money left in the deck, so once the economy dries up, the player with the
                    most money wins. Investment Andes was a group project and my contribution, along with my other
                    teammates, was the balancing of the game, the ideas for buildings and action cards, and the rules
                    of the game.

                <p>
                    An interactive simulation designed in Unity where autonomous human and zombie
                    "players" move independently through a system of steering forces. These forces are based on their
                    desires to either flee from zombies or catch any humans. Both humans and zombies
                    will also avoid obstacles, stay within the boundaries, and separate from each other if they are
                    extremely close to prevent stacking. The simulation has defaults for the amount of humans, zombies,
                    and obstacles but the player is able to add more in realtime. There are also options for multiple
                    camera views and debug mode which gives more details about each object's movement during runtime.

                <p>
                    A web application I designed that by default shows you the earthquakes that have occurred in the
                    world
                    in the past 6 hours, but also allows you to search a large database of recorded earthquakes with
                    various
                    parameters. I used the USGS Earthquake Catalog API as the database for the application and mapped
                    the data
                    received from the API with Mapbox. Earthquakes are dynamically sized proportionate to their
                    magnitude, and
                    can each be selected and focused on. The earthquakes can also be saved to another page for quick
                    access or
                    for going to the official site for that earthquake and seeing more information. You can search and
                    filter
                    earthquake results by the time of the quake, its magnitude, its depth, and by location. I also made
                    it so
                    the whole site is responsive and can be viewed and used on almost all devices.

                <p>
                    A website I designed and created that uses Javascript and the Pokemon TCG
                    API that allows the user to search for any Pokemon card using multiple search options and filters.
                    Once the user finds a card that they want to learn more about or see a clearer picture of, they can
                    simply click on the card and they are taken to a new page that has a higher resolution picture of
                    the card as well as all the important details of the card given in a much easier to read design. The
                    website is mainly for users who already know a fair amount about Pokemon cards and are looking for
                    something specific, but it helps users who might not know as much by restricting number inputs to
                    the valid range and certain filters so that there are fewer invalid queries to the API. The site is
                    also fully responsive with the exception of the filter popout not fitting the screens of some mobile
                    phones.
